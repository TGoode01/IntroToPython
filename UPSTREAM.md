# UPSTREAM.md

## Upstream Relationship

This repository is NOT the upstream source of the textbook materials.

The authoritative upstream repository for the book
**_Intro to Python for Computer Science and Data Science: Learning to Program with AI, Big Data and the Cloud_**
by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel is maintained by the authors at
<https://github.com/pdeitel/IntroToPython>.

That repository contains example source code and supporting materials
associated with the textbook, which are © Pearson Education, Inc.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is a **tooling and setup companion** intended to support:

- local execution of example code
- modern Python environment setup
- reproducible developer workflows
- VS Code–based inspection and experimentation

It does NOT redistribute textbook example files.

Students and instructors must obtain the textbook and any associated
materials separately.

## Scope of Changes

This repository may include:

- `pyproject.toml` and environment configuration
- dependency and tooling notes
- developer documentation
- CI and hygiene configuration
- annotations about execution issues or incompatibilities

It does NOT claim correctness, completeness, or equivalence with
the textbook examples.

## Attribution

All textbook content, examples, and intellectual property remain the
exclusive property of their respective authors and publisher.

See the upstream repository and book for canonical materials.

## Questions

Questions about textbook content should be directed to the authors
or publisher.

Questions about tooling or environment setup in this repository may be
raised via GitHub issues.
